There are two examples in this package.

One is for representing **[device orientation]**. This example will rotate
a tile so that it always faces the same direction as you spin your phone. The
tile will pan slightly when tilting the device.

The other visualizes **[device acceleration]**. Each color represents
acceleration along one dimension: `x` is cyan, `y` is magenta, `z` is yellow.
The colors blend together to indicate accelerations along multiple axes.
